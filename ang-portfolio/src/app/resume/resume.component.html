<pre><code>Description:
This is a project I am working on currently. The overall goal of this
project is to create a researcher-friendly tool that will allow
researchers to gather participant purchase task data without needing to
build their own purchase task implementation(s).</code></pre>

<pre><code>Description:
I wrote a version of the Attention Network Task that could be
administered via MATLAB. It allows researchers to define their own lists
of words, and gives the option to administer the task with a button box
or with the user&#39;s keyboard.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Description:
My first game! This is a final project for a graduate-level course in rich
web application development. The crate pusher game features a small
bulldozer controlled by the user. The objective of the game is to push a
target crate to the designated end point in as few moves as possible.
The game is written in PHP and JavaScript, uses a MySQL database, and
allows users to randomly generate puzzles and save them to the DB if the
user wins.</code></pre>
<h3 id="reaction-time-benchmarking"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcF9M9o2cFw" target="_blank" title="Button Presser">Reaction Time Benchmarking</a></h3>
<pre><code>Description:
During my time in graduate school I conducted feature testing of the
mEMA app for research using ecological momentary assessment. My
colleague and I are currently exploring ways to benchmark the accuracy
of the reaction time feature, which was built into the platform at our
request for one of our projects. I have designed several approaches for
testing its accuracy, including using MATLAB to communicate with light
sensors, Arduino-powered robotic styluses attached to servo motors. The
link shows one potential solution.

<h3 id="automated-data-cleaning-part-of-masters-thesis"><a href="http://rdcu.be/JUYm" target="_blank" title="Spelman &amp; Simons 2018">Automated Data Cleaning</a> (part of masters thesis)</h3>
<pre><code>Description:
Perhaps the most difficult part of this project was writing
the logic to detect irratic data and clean it. I wrote a script for the
Stata statistics package that would automatically go through all of the
responses by each participant and flag the data if there were
inconsistencies in responding. This algorithm would flag
inconsistencies, count the number of inconsistencies, and then
automatically recode data in which the inconsistency was deemed to be
trivial.

Future Direction:
I am currently working on a project that extends the work I did here.
See the Accessible Online Purchase Tasks project above for more details.</code></pre>
<h3 id="punching-machine-project">Punching Machine Project</h3>
<pre><code>Description:
This project used MATLAB, a FTDI UM245R USB-to-Parallel Interface, a
laser, and a photodiode, along with sections of PVC and wires that I put
together. The goal was to measure the speeed of fast punches and to
display the punch count and speed on the screen. The logic was based on
the signal from the photodiode, which was altered by breaking the laser
beam.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Description:

<pre><code>Description:
I integrated patient information from various sources, including opiate
substitution treatment records, urinalysis reports, and prescription
records from Washington Stateâs nascent Prescription Monitoring Program
(PMP). With Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic I built scripts to
facilitate the process of data entry, formulas to detect discrepancies
in data, and communicated the data to clinical service providers to
resolve the discrepancies. I used the data to produce graphical
representations of the organizationâs adoption and integration of the
PMP, and my graphs and tables were presented to the Washington State
Department of Health PMP Implementation Forum Meeting.</code></pre>
<h3 id="supportbuddy-volunteer-2008-2012">SUPPORTbuddy â Volunteer [2008 â 2012]</h3>
<pre><code>Description:
Online social networking and smartphone technology to improve treatment
outcomes and wellness, and to gather data to inform technology-based
intervention and assessment tools for physical and mental health

I became involved in this project as a product of my interest in the
integration of mental health intervention/research and technology. My
primary roles included exhibiting at mental health conferences,
networking with researchers, clinicians, and addiction treatment
organizations, and delivering this self-help tool to over 1,000 people
who could benefit from it.

Tech-related activities:
- Daily usage statistics via SQL queries on the SB database to summarize
  app usage and user demographics.
- Video production: I filmed and edited interviews with mental health
professionals to make promotional materials for the app.

Current direction:
The SB project eventually became inactive. Returning
to the field to begin my career as a developer, I am taking over the old
project to renew it and bring to it my vision for its future.</code></pre>
