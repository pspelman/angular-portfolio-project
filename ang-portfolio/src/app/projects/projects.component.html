    <h1>Crate Game</h1>
    <p>This was my first "game" endeavor. As a final project for a computer science course on rich web application development, I made this game. The user is a tiny bulldozer. The objective is to push the target crate to the end in as few moves as possible.</p>
    <p class="tech-used">Technology: PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, Canvas, MySQL</p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>VR allows students to visit other places and other times. For instance, the BBC produced a <a href="#">360Â° video</a> that allows users to see the scale of dinosaurs in stereoscopic 3D.</p>
